# I wrote today
A minimalist web app for tracking what days of the month you completed a task.

I use it to keep track of what days I worked on my writing, but you could also use it to keep track of what days you read a book, exercised, pet your cat...

## Developing
I Wrote Today is built with React with local storage for its "database". To work on the code, all you'll need to do is check out the repository and run `npm install`, then `npm start` to run a development server. To build a deployable version, run `npm run build`. There are currently no unit tests :(
